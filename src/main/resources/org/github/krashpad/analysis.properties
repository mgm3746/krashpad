ByteBuffer is not thread safe and must be accessed in a synchronized manner. Reference: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5625311.
error.dynatrace=Crash when executing Dynatrace code.
error.explicit.gc.disabled.eap7=Explicit garbage collection cannot be disabled on JBoss EAP7 because the IO subsystem uses direct memory (java.nio.DirectByteBuffer). The JVM uses explicit garbage collection to manage direct memory (to free space when MaxDirectMemorySize is reached), so disabling it can cause a memory leak. Remove -XX:+DisableExplicitGC, and if using the CMS or G1 collector, add -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent so explicit garbage collection is handled concurrently.

A workaround to avoid the crash is to disable memory mapping in ZipFile with -Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true (at the cost of some loss in performance), or upgrade to JDK 11. Backporting a fix to JDK8 would not address the root cause, and the OpenJDK developers have determined it is too risky. References: (1) https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6983666.

error.oome.external.or.hypervisor=Insufficient physical memory when the JVM memory is <95% physical memory. Determine which of the following is consuming the unaccounted memory: (1) External process(es), (2) Hypervisor memory ballooning. Possible resolutions: (1) Increase physical memory. (2) Slim external processes. (3) Do hypervisor tuning to ensure memory swapping does not happen (e.g. reserve virtual machine memory).
error.oome.external.startup=It appears there is not enough physical memory for the JVM to start. Decrease memory demands on the box and/or increase the available physical memory. The JVM process size is < 50% of available memory so the likely candidates for memory slimming are processes outside the JVM. If collocating multiple JVM instances, reduce JVM memory needs (e.g. decrease heap size) and/or decrease the number of instances. If a VM environment, check if memory ballooning has consumed memory on the VM.
error.oome.jboss.version=JBoss version check (e.g. standalone.sh --version) crash due to insufficient memory. The version check launches a full JVM with JBoss heap settings, so it's a very resource intensive way to check the version string.

warn.mmap.deleted=One or more mmapped resources are in a deleted state. Check if there is an issue preventing the MappedByteBuffer from being garbage collected (e.g. no regular GC because the heap is too large).
warn.oom.g1=The G1 collector does not manage memory footprint as efficiently as other collectors. Consider moving to the parallel collector or Shenandoah to decrease memory demands.
warn.oracle.jdbc.oci.connection=Crash when connecting to Oracle database using JDBC OCI (native) driver.
warn.rhel6=RHEL6 reached end of Maintenance Support II in November 2020. There will be no more RH builds of OpenJDK for RHEL6. Reference: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6033241.
warn.rhel7.power9=RHEL7 Power9 reached end of Maintenance Support II in May 2021 and is in Extended Update Phase. Red Hat will provide limited ongoing technical support. No bug fixes, security fixes, hardware enablement or root-cause analysis will be available during this phase, and support will be provided on existing installations only. Reference: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.
warn.swap.disabled.cms=The CMS collector is generally not appropriate when swap is disabled. It is recommended to use a collector that has better memory management like the parallel collector or Shenandoah.
warn.swap.disabled.g1=The G1 collector is generally not appropriate when swap is disabled. It is recommended to use a collector that has better memory management like the parallel collector or Shenandoah. 
warn.swapping=Swap usage >= 20%. Memory usage should be monitored to determine if physical memory should be increased and/or memory demands decreased.
warn.threads.many=Many threads (>5,000).
warn.unidentified.log.line=Unidentified log line(s). Please submit an issue so we can investigate: https://github.com/mgm3746/krashpad/issues. If attaching a fatal error log, be sure to review it and remove any sensitive information.
warn.vm.operation.thread.dump.jvmti=Crash happening during a thread dump initiated by an external tool calling the JVM tool interface (JVM TI).
warn.wily=Stack contains Wily/DX APM code.
